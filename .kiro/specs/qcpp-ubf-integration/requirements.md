# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document specifies the requirements for integrating the Quantum Coherence Protein Predictor (QCPP) and Universal Behavioral Framework (UBF) systems into a unified real-time protein structure prediction platform. The integration creates a bidirectional feedback loop where QCPP provides physics-based guidance to UBF agents during conformational exploration, while UBF provides dynamic validation data to QCPP. This eliminates the need for separate validation steps and grounds consciousness-based navigation in quantum physics.
