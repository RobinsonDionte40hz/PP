# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document specifies the requirements for integrating the Universal Behavioral Framework (UBF) with the existing quantum-inspired protein structure prediction system. The integration transforms protein folding prediction from a static physics-based approach into an experience-driven multi-agent learning system where agents navigate conformational space using consciousness coordinates (frequency and coherence), accumulate memories of successful/failed conformations, and continuously improve through collective learning.

## Glossary

- **UBF System**: The Universal Behavioral Framework - an experience-driven intelligence system using consciousness coordinates (frequency and coherence) to generate adaptive behavior without neural networks or training data
- **Protein Agent**: An autonomous agent that explores protein conformational space using UBF consciousness coordinates to guide folding decisions
- **Conformational Space**: The multi-dimensional space of all possible 3D protein structures (analogous to maze navigation space in the original UBF)
- **Consciousness Coordinates**: Two fundamental parameters - Frequency (3-15 Hz representing exploration energy) and Coherence (0.2-1.0 representing structural focus)
- **Behavioral State**: Six derived dimensions (energy, focus, mood, hydrophobic drive, risk tolerance, native state ambition) cached from consciousness coordinates
- **Conformational Move**: An action that changes protein structure (backbone rotation, sidechain adjustment, secondary structure formation, hydrophobic collapse)
- **Memory System**: Experience storage mechanism that records significant conformational states with their energies, preventing re-exploration of failed states
- **Shared Memory Pool**: Collective memory accessible to all agents, enabling collaborative learning across the multi-agent system
- **QAAP Calculator**: Quantum Amino Acid Potential calculator - existing module that computes quantum energy states for amino acids
- **Resonance Coupling**: Existing module calculating 40 Hz gamma synchronization between amino acid pairs
- **Native Structure**: The target lowest-energy folded state of a protein
- **RMSD**: Root Mean Square Deviation - metric measuring structural similarity between predicted and native structures (lower is better, target < 3Å)
- **GDT-TS**: Global Distance Test Total Score - protein structure quality metric (higher is better, target > 70)

## Requirements
