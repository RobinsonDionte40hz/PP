# Product Overview

## Quantum Coherence Protein Structure Predictor

A protein structure prediction system based on quantum coherence principles, golden ratio patterns, and resonance dynamics. The system predicts protein stability and structure without requiring training data, using physics-based quantum mechanics and the Universal Behavioral Framework (UBF).

## Core Capabilities

- **Quantum Consciousness Potential (QCP)**: Calculates energy states for each amino acid residue using the formula `QCP = 4 + (2^n × φ^l × m)` where φ is the golden ratio
- **Field Coherence Analysis**: Measures quantum coherence patterns across protein structures using phi-based resonance coupling
- **THz Spectroscopy Prediction**: Predicts terahertz absorption spectra based on phi-harmonic frequencies
- **Stability Prediction**: Estimates protein stability scores from quantum coherence metrics
- **Experimental Validation**: Correlates predictions with experimental stability data (melting temperature, ΔG, half-life)

## Key Innovation

Unlike traditional ML-based approaches (AlphaFold2), this system:
- Requires **zero training data**
- Uses **physics-grounded quantum mechanics** rather than learned patterns
- Provides **explainable predictions** through memory traces and quantum calculations
- Learns and improves during prediction through experience-driven intelligence

## Target Use Cases

- Protein stability prediction for drug design
- Novel fold exploration without training bias
- Understanding quantum coherence effects in biological systems
- Validating quantum-ionic consciousness theories in proteins
- Research into phi-based patterns in biological structures
